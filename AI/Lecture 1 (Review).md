# Introduction

- **AI**: discipline of creating *compuational model* that emulate:
    - Perception
    - Thoughts
    - Actions

- **AGI**: Stands for *Artificial General Intelligence* which is theoretical AI that have generalize expertise

- **Symbolic AI** (a.k.a Logic-Based Models) is AI that use logic and formal reasoning with rule-based manipulation and knowlege representation to solve a problem in a way that human can understand.
    - *Focus on explicit structured knowledge and clear rule need understanding of the concept and transparent reasoning*

## Symbolic Approach to NLP
- Mimic human language by using *vocabulary* (symbols) and *grammar* (rules).
- Is very transparent and explainable

> **Note**
> ML is a *central* sub-field of AI
> And DL is *sub-set* of ML

## 3 Waves of AI
1. Handcrafted Knowledge (We are here)
2. Statistical Learning
3. Contextual Adaptation
