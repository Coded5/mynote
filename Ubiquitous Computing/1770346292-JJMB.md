# Transport Protocol

## TCP (Overview)
- 90% of traffic is TCP
- Send data and wait for ACK (Acknowledge) if not receive then try again
- **Pipelined Protocol**: Send multiple segmnet and wait for multiple ACK if any ACK is missing resend only that part

> **Terminologies**
> Bandwidth: How much data can be sent in 1 second (ex. 1 Gbit/s)
> Bottleneck: High bandwidth get limited by one that have lower bandwidth
> Congestion: If too many packet are send they queued up causing congestion
> Congestion Window: prevent congestion by waiting (sending less packet)

## Snoop TCP

- If data is trasmitted from AP, AP "cache" the data and if it doesn't receive ACK then AP just send it instead of sender
