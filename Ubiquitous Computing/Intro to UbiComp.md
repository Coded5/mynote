# Intro to Ubiquitous Computing

## Evolution of Computing
1. Single User Systems
2. Batch Processing
3. Time-Sharing
4. Networked Computing
5. Mobile Computing
6. Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing

> "Profound technologies disappear and become indistinguishable from everyday life"
> \- Mark Weiser

## Ubiquitous Computing
- Integrate computer seamlessly into the world
    - Make it invisible, that's why some people call it *invisible/ pervasive computing*
    - AR
- "*Using computing should be as refreshing as a walk in the woods*" (*This is BS*)

- IoTs (Internet of Things) devices that connect to internet
- *Ex. Light turns on as you enter the room (Responsive Environment)*

### Phaes I: Tabs, Pads & Boards
- Shared meeting applications
- Location-based services
- **Tabs**
    - Small smart badge with user info
    - Allow personalized setting
    - Leave bio's behind after meeting
    - Wirelessly connected
    - Low-power processor
- **Pads** 
    - Paper size
    - Portable computer
    - No identity / Importance
- **Boards**
    - Whiteboard size
    - Meeting capture
    - Lots of bandwidth (because they're plugged in)

### Phase II: Smartphones / Mobile devices (Mobile Computing?)'
- Small size portable computers
- By: nomadic and mobile users (?)

> **Terms**
> **Nomadic Computing**: Portable but no mobility (Is not connected while moving)
> **Mobile Computing**: On-the-go connected even when moving
> **Ubiquitous Computing**: Computer everywhere and see can't see them

*The bigger the device the more compute*

# Wireless Networking
- WAN: Wide area Network
- MAN: Metro Area Network
- LAN: Local Area Network
- PAN: Personal Area Network

## Satellite
- Geosynchronous / Geostationary (stationary relative to earth rotation)
    - High latency, because its very high in the sky (36,000km)
- Low Earth Orbit
    - At 1000km
    - Lower latency but not stationary relative to earth's rotation so we have to do handoff
- *Ex. DirecPC* (+ Starlink?)
    - 400 Kb/s

## Microwave
- Range around 20 miles (32 km)
- Need line of sight (*point to point*)
- Can be absorbed by the rain

## Laser
- Line of sight with range 300m
- High bandwidth(?): 155 Mb/sec
- Expensive
